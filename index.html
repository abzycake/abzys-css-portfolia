            I have been interested in tech since I was very young, building my first computer at 12 and beginning to learn Python at the age of 13. I am currently learning Javascript and C# too. I love seeing problems and thinking about solutions in a logical, methodical way. I also love gaming and would love to code my own video game in Unity someday.
